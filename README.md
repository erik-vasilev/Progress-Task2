Dear Clien,
I'm happy to help you! In this repository you can find your code with the implemented final solution for your problem under the 'solution' comment.
Now your remove button is working perfectly fine and you can use it to remove the last item in the DropDownList component.
It was a pleasure to help you. If you have more questions I am online and ready to help at any time.

Best regards,
Erik Vasilev!
